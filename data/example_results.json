Current date awareness: I know today\u2019s date but don\u2019t automatically know events after my cutoff unless you provide them.\n- No live internet or external tools in this chat unless you explicitly connect them. I only know what you paste or describe here.\n- I don\u2019t retain personal data across sessions unless the app you\u2019re using provides a memory feature.\n\nWhat I can do\n- Explain concepts, brainstorm, outline, and write (emails, reports, specs, stories).\n- Code help: write, refactor, document, and reason about code; generate tests; suggest fixes from error messages.\n- Math, logic, and stepwise problem solving; convert requirements into formulas, SQL, or JSON.\n- Summarize and analyze text; compare options; extract structured data; translate.\n- Produce structured outputs on request (e.g., JSON, CSV, SQL, regex, bash).\n\nHow I reason and respond\n- I aim for correctness and clarity; when uncertain, I\u2019ll say so or ask clarifying questions.\n- I won\u2019t reveal my private chain-of-thought, but I can show key assumptions, intermediate calculations, and final reasoning summaries.\n- If you need citations or sources, ask\u2014I\u2019ll provide them when possible or explain limits.\n\nLimits and safety\n- I can be wrong or outdated. Double-check critical facts, code, and calculations.\n- I don\u2019t perform real-world actions or access private systems unless you paste data or connect tools.\n- I avoid harmful, illegal, or sensitive guidance and can\u2019t provide professional legal/medical advice.\n\nHow to get the best results\n- State your goal, audience, constraints (budget/time/format), and success criteria.\n- Provide examples or a schema if you want a specific format. Say \u201coutput JSON with fields: \u2026\u201d\n- Specify tone and length (e.g., \u201cbullet points, under 150 words\u201d).\n- For complex tasks: ask for a plan first, then have me execute step by step.\n- Tell me what to optimize for (accuracy, speed, creativity, cost).\n\nThings you can test right now\n- \u201cExplain diffusion models to a non-technical audience, 120 words.\u201d\n- \u201cGiven this error log, suggest likely causes and fixes.\u201d [paste log]\n- \u201cWrite a Python function and unit tests to validate IBANs.\u201d\n- \u201cConvert these requirements into a normalized SQL schema and sample queries.\u201d\n- \u201cSummarize this article into key takeaways and action items.\u201d [paste text]\n- \u201cGenerate a regex to validate US phone numbers, with examples.\u201d\n\nIf you tell me what aspect you want to test (reasoning, coding, summarization, planning, formatting), I\u2019ll tailor a quick demo.",
